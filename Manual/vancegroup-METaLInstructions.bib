abstract = {An experimental program of research was carried out to assess the potential health and safety effects of participating in virtual environments (VEs) via head-mounted displays (HMDs). This paper presents the results obtained from nine experiments examining the effects experienced during and after participation in a variety of VR systems, VE designs, and task requirements, for a total participant sample of 148 individuals. A combination of methods including self-report scales, performance measures, physiological indicators, observation, interview, and user attitude/opinion questionnaires were used to measure simulator (VE) sickness, postural instability, psychomotor control, perceptual judgment, concentration, stress, and ergonomics effects. Greatest effects across the different systems, VEs, and exposure times were found for sickness symptoms and physiological measures, with some concern over postural instability and physical ergonomics, also. Although many of the effects were relatively minor and short lived, they were serious for five percent of participants and irritating for a considerable percentage more. The aetiology of the effects is sufficiently different to that for simulators or transport systems to justify us using a new term, virtual reality-induced symptoms and effects (VRISE). Implications are drawn for VR system design, VE specification, and the ways in which industrial use of VR/VE should be planned and supported.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) systems are used in a variety of applications within industry, education, public and domestic settings. Research assessing reported symptoms and side effects of using VR systems indicates that these factors combine to influence user experiences of virtual reality induced symptoms and effects (VRISE). Three experiments were conducted to assess prevalence and severity of sickness symptoms experienced in each of four VR display conditions; head mounted display (HMD), desktop, projection screen and reality theatre, with controlled examination of two additional aspects of viewing (active vs. passive viewing and light vs. dark conditions). Results indicate 60-70\% participants experience an increase in symptoms pre-post exposure for HMD, projection screen and reality theatre viewing and found higher reported symptoms in HMD compared with desktop viewing (nausea symptoms) and in HMD compared with reality theatre viewing (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation symptoms). No effect of lighting condition was found. Higher levels of symptoms were reported in passive viewing compared to active control over movement in the VE. However, the most notable finding was that of high inter- and intra-participant variability. As this supports other findings of individual susceptibility to VRISE, recommendations are offered concerning design and use of VR systems in order to minimise VRISE. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
